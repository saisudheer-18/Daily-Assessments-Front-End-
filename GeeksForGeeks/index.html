        <b>HTML</b> stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language.</strong> It is the standard language used to create and
        structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how to display text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a
        webpage. HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity
        to make it look and function better.
    </p>

        How Does HTML Work? - HTML documents are plain-text files saved with an <em>.html extension</em>. Browsers read
        these documents, interpret the markup (tags and attributes), and render the formatted content on your screen.

    <h3>HTML Page Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The basic structure of an HTML page is shown below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e.
        doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.
    </p>

         alt="HTML Page Structure" width="500" height="400">

    <ul>
        <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the document is an HTML5 document.</li>
        <li>&lt;html&gt; - This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.</li>
        <li>&lt;head&gt; - The head tag contains the "behind the scenes" elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren't visible on the front end of a webpage. Typical elements inside the head include:</li>
    </ul>

    <ul type="circle">
        <li>&lt;title&gt;: Defines the title displayed on the browser tab.</li>
        <li>&lt;meta&gt;: Provides information like the character set or viewport settings.</li>
        <li>&lt;link&gt;: Links external stylesheets or resources.</li>
        <li>&lt;style&gt;: Embeds internal CSS styles.</li>
        <li>&lt;script&gt;: Embeds JavaScript for functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>&lt;title&gt; - The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the title of the webpage that you are viewing.</li>
        <li>&lt;h2&gt;- The <h2> tag is a second-level heading tag.</li>
        <li>&lt;p&gt;- The <p> tag represents a paragraph of text.</li>
        <li>&lt;body&gt; - The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An HTML document can be created using an HTML text editor. Save the text file using the ".html" or ".htm" extension. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.</p>
    <i>Note: Basic/built-in text editors are <em><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-notepad/">Notepad</a></em> (Windows) and TextEdit (MacOS). Other advanced text editors include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, etc.</i>
    <h3>HTML Elements and HTML Tag</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-html-tag/">HTML</a>Elements and HTML Tags are related but distinct. An HTML element is the complete structure, including the opening tag, content (if any), and the closing tag (if applicable).</p>
    <p>On the other hand, A <b>tag</b> is the actual keyword or name enclosed in angle brackets (< >) that tells the browser what kind of content to expect.</p>

    <h3>HTML History</h3>
    <p>Currently, we are using HTML5, which is the latest and most advanced version of HTML.</p>
    <ul><li>HTML was initially created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a way to share and structure documents on the web.</li>
    <li>The first-ever version was HTML 1.0, a basic and limited version. However, the first standardized version, HTML 2.0, was published in 1995, laying the foundation for web development as we know it today.</li>
</ul>
